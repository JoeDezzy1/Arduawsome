# Arduawsome

This is a custom arduino script I've built in arduino's native C++ for a hackathon in 2016.

If you have to do a project for arduino, feel free to use this.

The script does the following:
1. Flashes LED's in synchrony to the super mario bros. theme song.
2. Plays the super mario theme song through digial output by generating its own beeps
3. Handles touch/temperature recognition.
4. Displays messages on an LED screen if plugged in when the user touches a sensor or plays a song.

There may be a few things I left out... find out for yourself!
